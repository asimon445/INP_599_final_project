The fMRI data used in this project is split into 10 different files, because the data were too big to upload to github in a single file. The files are labeled as
'connmats_x.mat', where x is 1-10. They are ordered in ascending order, so the analysis script will read them in from connmats_1.mat to connmats_10.mat.
